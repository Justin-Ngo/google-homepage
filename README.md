# google-homepage
First HTML/CSS on Odin Project.

Learning HTML/CSS/Javascript on my own now that I'm out of university. I went to school as a mechanical engineer so I didn't get a lot of exposure to different types of programming. 

This is the first of many :)

# Outcome / Skills
Replicated Google Homepage with HTML/CSS. Learned CSS Selectors and the various ways to use them, web typography and flexbox.
